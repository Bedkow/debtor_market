## Debtor app 
[DEMO](https://debtors-dbednarek.netlify.app/) - not working atm, troubleshooting

An app that collects debtors' data and displays it.
It contains a search input to filter debtors.

Tools used:
- React.js with npx create-react-app and hooks
- [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
- LESS
- ES6+
- REST API

### ***Important***:
The API used for the project uses http instead of https. As a result it gets blocked by browsers. To overcome it, for the sake of presentation, I hardcoded the JSON data from the API in separate JSON files.


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
